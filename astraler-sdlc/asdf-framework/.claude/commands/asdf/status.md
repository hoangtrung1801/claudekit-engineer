## Mission

Generate comprehensive project status report and update the project heartbeat file.

## Pre-Execution

1. Activate `context-loading` skill
2. Scan all documentation tiers

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Metrics

**Feature Status:**
- Count specs in `asdf-docs/03-features/` by status:
  - Draft (not approved)
  - Approved (not started)
  - In Progress
  - Complete
  - Reverse Synced

**Implementation Status:**
- Review `asdf-docs/04-operations/implementation-active.md`
- Count active tasks, blocked items, completed items

**Last Activity:**
- Check `asdf-docs/04-operations/session-handoff.md` for last session date
- Review recent `asdf-docs/04-operations/changelog/` entries

### Step 2: Calculate Progress

```
Total Features = Draft + Approved + In Progress + Complete
Completion % = (Complete / Total Features) * 100
```

### Step 3: Identify Health Indicators

**Green (Healthy):**
- Progress being made
- No long-standing blockers
- Specs in sync with code

**Yellow (Attention):**
- Features in progress > 3 sessions
- Pending reverse syncs
- Outdated session handoffs (> 7 days)

**Red (Critical):**
- Blocked items with no resolution
- Significant spec-code drift
- Missing documentation

### Step 4: Update Project Status

Update `asdf-docs/01-system-core/project-status.md`:

```markdown
# Project Status (Heartbeat)

## Overall Progress
- Features Planned: [N]
- Features In Progress: [N]
- Features Complete: [N]
- Completion: [X]%

## Health: [Green/Yellow/Red]

## Current Phase
[Phase name based on progress]

## Active Work
| Feature | Status | Last Updated |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [name] | In Progress | [YYMMDD] |

## Recent Activity
- [YYMMDD] [Activity description]
- [YYMMDD] [Activity description]

## Blockers
| Issue | Feature | Since | Priority |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| [description] | [feature] | [YYMMDD] | [High/Med/Low] |

## Upcoming
- [ ] [Next planned feature/task]
- [ ] [Next planned feature/task]

## Notes
[Any important context]

---
Last Updated: [YYMMDD]
Generated by: /asdf:status
```

### Step 5: Generate Summary Report

Output to user:

```
PROJECT STATUS REPORT - [YYMMDD]

Health: [Indicator]

Progress: [X]% Complete
- [N] features complete
- [N] in progress
- [N] planned

Active Work:
- [Feature 1]: [Brief status]
- [Feature 2]: [Brief status]

Blockers: [N]
- [Brief blocker summary if any]

Last Session: [YYMMDD]
- [What was done]

Recommendations:
- [Action items based on health]

Status file updated: asdf-docs/01-system-core/project-status.md
```

## Post-Execution

If Yellow or Red health detected, suggest:
- `/asdf:sync` if spec drift detected
- `/asdf:handoff` if session outdated
- Architect review if blockers exist
