## Tiered UI Design System Structure

### **Level 1: System UI Design** 
📄 File: `1.system-ui-design.md`

**When to use:**
- After having System TDD
- Need to design overall Design System for the entire system
- Need to break down design into domains/modules

**Input:**
- System PRD (already available from BA)
- System SAD (already available from SA)
- System TDD (already available)
- Target audience and brand guidelines

**Output:**
- Design Philosophy and Visual Identity
- Color Palette and Typography system
- Component Library overview
- Overall Layout System
- Design Tokens and Spacing system

---

### **Level 2: Domain UI Design**
📄 File: `2.domain-ui-design.md`

**When to use:**
- After having System UI Design and Domain TDD
- Need to design detailed UI for a specific domain/module
- Domain has many complex screens/pages

**Input:**
- System UI Design (already available)
- Domain PRD (already available from BA)
- Domain TDD (already available)
- Domain-specific requirements

**Output:**
- Domain-specific components and patterns
- Page layouts for domain
- Navigation structure for domain
- Domain-specific design patterns
- Component variations for domain

---

### **Level 3: Feature UI Design**
📄 File: `3.feature-ui-design.md`

**When to use:**
- After having Domain UI Design and Feature TDD
- Need to design detailed UI for a specific feature/screen
- Feature needs immediate implementation

**Input:**
- Domain UI Design (already available)
- Feature PRD (already available from BA)
- Feature TDD (already available)
- User stories and acceptance criteria

**Output:**
- Detailed wireframe for feature
- Component breakdown and props
- State management design
- Interaction design and micro-interactions
- Responsive design specifications
- Sufficient information for developer to code UI

## Recommended Workflow

### **Step 1: System UI Design (Level 1)**
```
1. Use prompt: 1.system-ui-design.md
2. Input: System PRD + System SAD + System TDD + Brand guidelines
3. Output: System UI Design (Design System overview)
4. Review design system with team
```

### **Step 2: Domain UI Design (Level 2) - Repeat for each domain**
```
1. Select a domain/module from System UI Design
2. Use prompt: 2.domain-ui-design.md
3. Input: System UI Design + Domain PRD + Domain TDD
4. Output: Domain UI Design + List of screens in domain
5. Review domain UI design with team
```

### **Step 3: Feature UI Design (Level 3) - Repeat for each feature**
```
1. Select a feature/screen from Domain UI Design
2. Use prompt: 3.feature-ui-design.md
3. Input: Domain UI Design + Feature PRD + Feature TDD
4. Output: Detailed Feature UI Design
5. Developer starts implementation
```

## Breakdown Principles

### **When to divide into Domain/Module:**
- When domain has > 5 complex screens/pages
- When domain has distinct design patterns
- When domain has its own team
- When domain has its own navigation structure

### **When to divide into Feature/Screen:**
- When feature has > 3 user stories
- When feature has complex UI with many states
- When feature needs > 1 sprint to implement
- When feature has many interactions and micro-animations

## Important Notes

1. **Always start from Level 1** - Don't skip System UI Design
2. **Consistency** - Ensure Domain and Feature UI Designs follow System UI Design
3. **Traceability** - Each Feature UI Design must reference Domain UI Design and System UI Design
4. **Alignment** - Each UI Design level must align with corresponding PRD, SAD, and TDD level
5. **Reusability** - Focus on reusable components and patterns
