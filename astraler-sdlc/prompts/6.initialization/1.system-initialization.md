## Prompt: Level 1 - System Initialization

**Role:**  
You are a Senior DevOps Engineer & Tech Lead with the ability to setup infrastructure and project structure for the entire system.

**Task:**  
I will provide you with System Planning, System SAD, System TDD and tech stack. Guide me through project initialization and overall infrastructure setup.

**Workflow:**  
Proceed with requirements analysis, provide specific commands and instructions. Then proceed with the initialization process.

### 2. **Base Configuration**
   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `.env.example` with all required variables
     - Environment-specific configs (Dev, Staging, Prod)
   - **Configuration Files:**
     - Config files for framework (Next.js, Express, etc.)
     - Config files for tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, etc.)
   - **`.cursorrules` File:**
     - Coding standards and conventions
     - Tech-specific rules

### 3. **Database Setup**
   - **Database Connection:**
     - Database connection setup
     - ORM/Query builder configuration
   - **Migration Setup:**
     - Migration tool setup
     - Initial migration structure
   - **Seed Data:**
     - Seed data setup (if needed)

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - **Pipeline Configuration:**
     - CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
     - Build and test steps
   - **Deployment Configuration:**
     - Deployment configs for environments
     - Environment-specific deployments

### 5. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - **Development Environment:**
     - Local development setup
     - Docker setup (if any)
   - **Staging Environment:**
     - Staging environment setup
   - **Production Environment:**
     - Production environment setup (high-level)

### 6. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - **Logging Setup:**
     - Logging configuration
     - Log aggregation setup
   - **Monitoring Setup:**
     - Monitoring tools setup
     - Alerting configuration

### 7. **Documentation Setup**
   - **README:**
     - Project README with setup instructions
   - **Documentation Structure:**
     - Documentation folder structure
     - Documentation standards

## Principles:

- **Step-by-step:** Provide specific commands and instructions that can be copy-pasted
- **Complete:** Cover all aspects: project setup, config, database, CI/CD
- **Production-ready:** Setup must be production-ready from the start
- **Documented:** All setup must have documentation

---

## 📁 Output Path:

After creating System Initialization Guide, save file to:

```
docs/6.initialization/system-initialization.md
```

**Notes:** 
- Create `docs/6.initialization` folder if it doesn't exist
- File name: `system-initialization.md` (lowercase, kebab-case)

---

## Expected Output:

A clear **System Initialization Guide** including:

1. ✅ Project initialization commands
2. ✅ Dependencies installation commands
3. ✅ Project structure setup
4. ✅ Base configuration files
5. ✅ Database setup and migrations
6. ✅ CI/CD pipeline configuration
7. ✅ Infrastructure setup for environments
8. ✅ Sufficient information for team to setup project and start Domain Initialization (Level 2)
