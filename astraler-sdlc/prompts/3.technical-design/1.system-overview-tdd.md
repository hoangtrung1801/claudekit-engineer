## Prompt: Level 1 - System Overview TDD

**Role:**  
You are a Full-Stack Solution Architect with comprehensive thinking about both System and Product. You have the ability to analyze and break down large projects into manageable domains/modules.

**Task:**  
I will provide you with PRD (Product Requirements Document) and SAD (Solution Architecture Document). Create a **System Overview TDD** - an overall technical design document for the entire system.

**Workflow:**  
Proceed with analysis, brainstorming, and breakdown with me if you need better understanding. Then proceed with the System Overview TDD process.

## System Overview TDD Requirements:

### 1. **Executive Summary**
   - Brief system overview (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Main objectives and business value
   - System scope and boundaries
   - Key stakeholders

### 2. **System Architecture Overview**
   - **High-level Architecture Diagram:**

     - Frontend, Backend, Database, External Services
     - Message queues, Caching layers, CDN (if any)
   - **Architecture Pattern:**
     - Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, or Hybrid?
     - Reason for choosing this pattern
   - **Data Flow Overview:**
     - Overall data flow from Frontend → Backend → Database
     - Event and async operations flow (if any)

### 3. **Domain/Module Breakdown**
   - **Divide system into domains/modules:**
     - List all main domains/modules
     - Brief description of each domain's function (2-3 sentences)
     - Identify dependencies between domains
   - **Domain Boundaries:**
     - Bounded Context for each domain (if applying DDD)
     - Database per domain or shared database?
   - **Domain Ownership:**
     - Team/owner responsible for each domain (if defined)

### 4. **Technology Stack**
   - **Frontend Stack:**
     - Framework, UI library, state management
     - Specific version and reason for choice
   - **Backend Stack:**
     - Language, framework, version
     - Reason for choice and alternatives considered
   - **Database Stack:**
     - SQL/NoSQL databases for each domain
     - Caching solutions (Redis, Memcached)
     - Search engines (Elasticsearch, Algolia) if any
   - **Infrastructure Stack:**
     - Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
     - Container orchestration (Docker, K8s)
     - CI/CD tools
     - Monitoring and logging tools

### 5. **Integration Architecture**
   - **Internal Integrations:**
     - How domains/modules communicate with each other
     - API contracts and communication protocols
     - Event-driven architecture (if any)
   - **External Integrations:**
     - Third-party services and APIs
     - Webhooks and callbacks
     - Payment gateways, SMS/Email services, etc.
   - **Integration Patterns:**
     - Synchronous vs Asynchronous
     - API Gateway pattern
     - Service mesh (if any)

### 6. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - **Authentication & Authorization:**
     - Centralized auth or distributed?
     - SSO, OAuth, JWT strategy
   - **Security:**
     - Data encryption strategy
     - Security policies and compliance requirements
   - **Logging & Monitoring:**
     - Centralized logging approach
     - Metrics and alerting strategy
     - APM tools
   - **Error Handling:**
     - Global error handling strategy
     - Error tracking and reporting

### 7. **Scalability & Performance Strategy**
   - **Scaling Approach:**
     - Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
     - Auto-scaling policies
   - **Performance Targets:**
     - Response time goals
     - Throughput requirements
     - Concurrent users capacity
   - **Caching Strategy:**
     - Caching layers and locations
     - Cache invalidation strategy

### 8. **Deployment Architecture**
   - **Environments:**
     - Dev, Staging, Production setup
     - Environment-specific configurations
   - **Deployment Strategy:**
     - Blue-green, Canary, Rolling deployment?
     - CI/CD pipeline overview
   - **Infrastructure as Code:**
     - IaC approach (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)

### 9. **Data Architecture Overview**
   - **Database Strategy:**
     - Database per domain or shared?
     - Read replicas and sharding strategy
   - **Data Flow:**
     - ETL processes (if any)
     - Data warehouse and analytics (if any)
   - **Backup & Recovery:**
     - Backup strategy
     - Disaster recovery plan

### 10. **Domain Roadmap & Priorities**
    - **Phases/Releases:**
      - Breakdown by phases (MVP, Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
      - Domains/modules in each phase
    - **Dependencies:**
      - Implementation order of domains (based on dependencies)
      - Critical path analysis
    - **Timeline Estimate:**
      - High-level timeline for each phase
      - Milestones and deliverables

### 11. **Risks & Mitigations**
    - **Technical Risks:**
      - Top 3-5 technical risks
      - Mitigation strategies
    - **Architecture Trade-offs:**
      - Trade-offs made
      - Reasons and consequences

---

## Principles:

- **High-level focus:** Don't go into implementation details, focus on overall architecture
- **Breakdown clarity:** Clear domain/module division, can be developed independently
- **Traceability:** Every domain/module must map to features in PRD
- **Practical:** Design must be feasible with available timeline and resources
- **Documentation:** Use diagrams (Mermaid) and structured format for easy understanding

## 📁 Output Path:

After creating System Overview TDD, save file to:

```
docs/3.technical-design/system-overview-tdd.md
```

**Notes:** 
- Create `docs/3.technical-design` folder if it doesn't exist
- File name: `system-overview-tdd.md` (lowercase, kebab-case)

## Expected Output:

A clear **System Overview TDD** including:

1. ✅ System architecture overview with diagrams
2. ✅ Complete list of domains/modules with brief descriptions
3. ✅ Overall technology stack
4. ✅ Integration architecture between components
5. ✅ Roadmap breakdown by phases/domains
6. ✅ Sufficient information for team to start Domain TDD (Level 2)

**Note:** This document will be the foundation for all subsequent Domain TDDs and Feature TDDs. Ensure it's complete but not too detailed.
