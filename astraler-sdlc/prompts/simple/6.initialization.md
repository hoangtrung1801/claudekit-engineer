# ROLE
You are a Senior DevOps Engineer & Tech Lead.

# CONTEXT
I want to initialize a new project based on the Tech Stack and System Design defined in existing documents.

# INPUT CONTEXT
- **Tech Stack:** [Tech stack from SAD]
- **System Design:** [System design from TDD]
- **Database Schema:** [Database schema from TDD]

# TASK
1. Guide me through project initialization commands (e.g., `npx create-next-app...`) with correct flags (TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router...).
2. After init, guide me to install all dependencies listed in Tech Stack.
3. Delete default boilerplate code and create empty folder structure exactly as in System Design.
4. Write `.env.example` file containing all required environment variables.
5. Set up Database connection and write migration files to initialize tables.

# GOAL
At the end of this step, I want a running, clean repo with correct standard folder structure.

# GUIDELINES
- **Step-by-step:** Provide specific commands and instructions that can be copy-pasted
- **Complete:** Cover all aspects: project setup, config, database
- **Keep it Simple:** Since this is a simple project, don't setup too complex
