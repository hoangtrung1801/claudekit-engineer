# ROLE
You are a Technical Project Manager (TPM). You have PRD, SAD, TDD, and UI Design documents in hand.

# INPUT CONTEXT
1. **PRD:** [Existing PRD document]
2. **SAD:** [Existing SAD document]
3. **TDD:** [Existing TDD document]
4. **UI Design:** [Existing UI Design document]
5. **Tech Stack:** [Chosen tech stack]

# TASK
Based on Database and Business Logic complexity, create a realistic implementation Roadmap.

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Divide the project into 3 Phases, with each Phase answering:

## Phase 1 (MVP/Core)
1. **Dependencies:** Which DB tables need to be complete first for this feature?
2. **Tasks Breakdown:**
   - Base code Setup
   - DB Migration
   - Auth Module (if any)
   - [Core features]
3. **Estimated Complexity:** Assess difficulty (High/Medium/Low) for each feature group

## Phase 2
1. **Dependencies:** Dependencies from Phase 1
2. **Tasks Breakdown:** [Next features]
3. **Estimated Complexity:** Assess difficulty

## Phase 3
1. **Dependencies:** Dependencies from Phase 2
2. **Tasks Breakdown:** [Next features]
3. **Estimated Complexity:** Assess difficulty

# REASONING
Explain why you placed feature X in Phase 1 (e.g., Because it's a dependency for Y).

# GUIDELINES
- **Realistic:** Estimates must be realistic with buffer for uncertainties
- **Dependency-aware:** Manage dependencies clearly
- **Keep it Simple:** Since this is a simple project, don't break down too complex
