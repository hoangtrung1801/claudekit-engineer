## Prompt: Technical Design Document (TDD) - Simple Project

**Role:**  
You are a Full-Stack Solution Architect with comprehensive thinking about both System and Product.

**Task:**  
I will provide you with PRD (Product Requirements Document) and SAD (Solution Architecture Document). Transform these documents into a complete, detailed Technical Design Document (TDD).

**Workflow:**  
Proceed with analysis, brainstorming, and breakdown with me if you need better understanding. Then proceed with the TDD process.

## TDD Requirements:

### 1. **System Architecture Overview**
   - System architecture overview: describe main components and how they interact
   - Architecture Diagram - can use Mermaid or detailed description to draw
   - High-level Data Flow

### 2. **Technology Stack**
   - Detailed technology for each layer: Frontend, Backend, Database, Infrastructure
   - Reason for choice and alternatives considered
   - Specific version of main technologies

### 3. **Frontend & UI Modules**
   - Clear description of each screen, components (e.g., Dashboard, Filter, Charts)
   - Component hierarchy and props/state management
   - Routing and navigation flow
   - Responsive design and accessibility considerations
   - Ensure fully addressing user needs stated in PRD

### 4. **Backend & Database**
   - Detailed data schema design: ERD, tables, relationships, indexes, constraints
   - Complete API Specifications: endpoints, request/response format, status codes
   - Authentication & Authorization mechanisms
   - Data validation rules and business rules at database layer
   - Migration strategy for database changes

### 5. **Core Logic & Business Rules**
   - Analyze, design, and express complex business logic following SAD direction
   - Clarify business processing workflow, data flow
   - State machine or workflow diagrams for complex processes
   - Business rules and validation logic

### 6. **API Design**
   - RESTful API or GraphQL schema (depending on choice)
   - Request/Response examples for each endpoint
   - Error handling: error codes, error messages, retry logic
   - Rate limiting and throttling strategies (if needed)
   - API versioning strategy

### 7. **Security**
   - Authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
   - Authorization and role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Data encryption (in-transit and at-rest)
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Security best practices (OWASP Top 10)

### 8. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Caching strategy (Redis, CDN, browser cache)
   - Database optimization: indexing, query optimization
   - Load balancing and horizontal scaling approach (if needed)
   - Performance targets and SLAs
   - Monitoring and alerting strategy

### 9. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   - Error handling patterns for each layer
   - Retry logic and circuit breaker patterns (if needed)
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Logging strategy and error tracking

### 10. **Integration Points**
   - Third-party services integration (if any)
   - External APIs and webhooks
   - Message queues and event-driven architecture (if any)
   - Integration testing strategy

### 11. **Deployment & Infrastructure**
   - Deployment architecture and environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)
   - CI/CD pipeline design
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach
   - Monitoring, logging, and observability tools
   - Backup and disaster recovery plan

### 12. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing approach
   - Integration testing strategy
   - End-to-end testing plan
   - Performance testing and load testing (if needed)
   - Test coverage goals

## Principles:

- **Comprehensiveness:** Every feature in PRD must have corresponding technical design (1:1 mapping)
- **Balance:** Don't focus only on backend but comprehensively cover frontend as well
- **Practical:** Design must be feasible, implementable with defined technology and timeline
- **Detailed:** Provide enough information for developers to start coding without asking many questions
- **Clear:** Use diagrams, examples, and structured format for easy reading and understanding
- **Keep it Simple:** Since this is a simple project, prioritize simple and practical solutions

---

## Expected Output:

A clear, detailed, easy-to-read Technical Design Document (TDD) meeting all above requirements. Document must be detailed enough for:
- Developers to start implementation immediately
- QA to write test cases based on it
- Product Owner to review and validate design meets requirements
- Team Lead to estimate effort and plan sprint
