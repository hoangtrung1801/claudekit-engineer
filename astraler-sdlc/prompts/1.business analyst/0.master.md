## Tiered PRD System Structure

### **Level 1: System PRD** 
📄 File: `1.system-prd.md`

**When to use:**
- Starting a new or large project
- Need an overview of the entire product
- Need to break down project into domains/modules

**Input:**
- Raw requirements from stakeholder/client
- Business goals and objectives
- Constraints and limitations

**Output:**
- Product overview and business value
- List of main domains/modules
- User personas and overall RBAC
- High-level user flows
- Roadmap breakdown by domains

---

### **Level 2: Domain PRD**
📄 File: `2.domain-prd.md`

**When to use:**
- After having System PRD
- Need detailed requirements analysis for a specific domain/module
- Domain has many complex features

**Input:**
- System PRD (already available)
- Detailed requirements for domain/module
- Business context and domain constraints

**Output:**
- Detailed functional requirements for domain
- Detailed user flows within domain
- Business rules and validation rules
- Entity dictionary for domain
- List of features in domain (for Level 3)
- Non-functional requirements for domain

---

### **Level 3: Feature PRD**
📄 File: `3.feature-prd.md`

**When to use:**
- After having Domain PRD
- Need detailed requirements analysis for a specific feature
- Feature needs immediate development

**Input:**
- Domain PRD (already available)
- User stories and acceptance criteria for feature
- Specific business context for feature

**Output:**
- Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Detailed user flow for feature
- Specific business rules and edge cases
- Detailed UI/UX requirements
- Data requirements and validation rules
- Test scenarios and success criteria

---

## Recommended Workflow

### **Step 1: System PRD (Level 1)**
```
1. Use prompt: 1.system-prd.md
2. Input: Raw requirements + Business goals
3. Output: System PRD + List of domains/modules
4. Review and break down domains with stakeholders
```

### **Step 2: Domain PRD (Level 2) - Repeat for each domain**
```
1. Select a domain/module from System PRD
2. Use prompt: 2.domain-prd.md
3. Input: System PRD + Domain requirements + Business context
4. Output: Domain PRD + List of features in domain
5. Review domain requirements with stakeholders
```

### **Step 3: Feature PRD (Level 3) - Repeat for each feature**
```
1. Select a feature from Domain PRD
2. Use prompt: 3.feature-prd.md
3. Input: Domain PRD + User stories + Acceptance criteria
4. Output: Detailed Feature PRD
5. Development team starts SAD and TDD
```

## Breakdown Principles

### **When to divide into Domain/Module:**
- When domain has > 5 complex features
- When domain can be independent in terms of business logic
- When domain has its own team
- When domain has distinct user personas

### **When to divide into Feature:**
- When feature has > 3 user stories
- When feature needs > 1 sprint to implement
- When feature has complex business logic
- When feature has many edge cases

## 5 Analysis Tasks (Apply at all levels)

1. **Ambiguity Detection:** Detect vague wording
2. **Missing Flows:** Find missing flows (Happy & Rainy paths)
3. **Entity Dictionary:** Standardize terminology
4. **Operational & NFR Scan:** Security, Observability, Data Strategy
5. **Technical Feasibility:** Ensure requirements are feasible

---

## Important Notes

1. **Always start from Level 1** - Don't skip System PRD
2. **Iterative approach** - Can return to Level 1 to refine when needed
3. **Consistency** - Ensure Domain PRD and Feature PRD align with System PRD
4. **Traceability** - Each Feature PRD must reference Domain PRD and System PRD
5. **Parallel work** - After System PRD, can work on multiple Domain PRDs in parallel
