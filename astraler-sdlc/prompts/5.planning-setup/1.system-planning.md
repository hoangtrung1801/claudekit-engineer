## Prompt: Level 1 - System Planning

**Role:**  
You are a Technical Project Manager (TPM) with the ability to create overall planning for the entire system based on existing documents.

**Task:**  
I will provide you with System PRD, System SAD, System TDD, System UI Design and business constraints. Create a **System Planning** - an overall roadmap for the entire system.

**Workflow:**  
Proceed with analysis, complexity evaluation, and breakdown with me if you need better understanding. Then proceed with the System Planning process.

## System Planning Requirements:

### 1. **Executive Summary**
   - **Project Overview:**
     - Project overview and scope
     - Business objectives and success criteria
   - **Timeline Overview:**
     - Expected total timeline
     - Key milestones
   - **Resource Overview:**
     - Team structure and roles
     - Overall resource allocation

### 2. **Phases Breakdown**
   - **Phase 1 (MVP/Core):**
     - Core features and domains in this phase
     - Dependencies and prerequisites
     - Timeline estimate
     - Success criteria
   - **Phase 2:**
     - Features and domains in this phase
     - Dependencies from Phase 1
     - Timeline estimate
   - **Phase 3:**
     - Features and domains in this phase
     - Dependencies from Phase 2
     - Timeline estimate
   - **Additional Phases:** (if any)

### 3. **Domain Dependencies Analysis**
   - **Dependency Graph:**
     - Dependencies between domains
     - Critical path analysis
   - **Domain Priorities:**
     - Priority of each domain
     - Business value and technical complexity
   - **Domain Sequencing:**
     - Implementation order of domains
     - Parallel work opportunities

### 4. **Resource Planning**
   - **Team Structure:**
     - Team composition and roles
     - Team assignments for each domain
   - **Resource Allocation:**
     - Allocation for each phase
     - Resource constraints and assumptions
   - **Capacity Planning:**
     - Team capacity estimates
     - Buffer and contingency

### 5. **Timeline & Milestones**
   - **High-Level Timeline:**
     - Timeline for each phase
     - Key milestones and deliverables
   - **Critical Path:**
     - Critical path analysis
     - Bottlenecks and risks
   - **Buffer & Contingency:**
     - Buffer time for uncertainties
     - Contingency plans

### 6. **Risk Assessment (High-level)**
   - **Technical Risks:**
     - Overall technical risks
     - Mitigation strategies
   - **Resource Risks:**
     - Resource-related risks
     - Mitigation strategies
   - **Dependency Risks:**
     - Dependency-related risks
     - Mitigation strategies

### 7. **Success Metrics**
   - **Phase Success Criteria:**
     - Success criteria for each phase
     - Definition of done
   - **KPIs:**
     - Key performance indicators
     - Measurement approach

### 8. **Communication & Reporting**
   - **Stakeholder Communication:**
     - Communication plan
     - Reporting frequency and format
   - **Team Communication:**
     - Team sync and standup schedule
     - Communication channels

## Principles:

- **Realistic:** Estimates must be realistic with buffer for uncertainties
- **Dependency-aware:** Manage dependencies clearly
- **Flexible:** Can adjust when more information is available
- **Traceable:** Every phase must map to System PRD/SAD/TDD
- **Practical:** Planning must be actionable and executable

---

## 📁 Output Path:

After creating System Planning, save file to:

```
docs/5.planning-setup/system-planning.md
```

**Notes:** 
- Create `docs/5.planning-setup` folder if it doesn't exist
- File name: `system-planning.md` (lowercase, kebab-case)

---

## Expected Output:

A clear **System Planning** including:

1. ✅ Phases breakdown with timeline and milestones
2. ✅ Domain dependencies analysis and sequencing
3. ✅ Resource planning and team structure
4. ✅ Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
5. ✅ Success metrics and KPIs
6. ✅ Sufficient information for team to start Domain Planning (Level 2)

**Note:** This document will be the foundation for all subsequent Domain Planning and Feature Planning. Ensure it's complete but not too detailed about specific tasks.
