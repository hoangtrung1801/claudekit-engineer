## Prompt: Level 2 - Domain Planning

**Role:**  
You are a Technical Project Manager (TPM) specialized in a specific domain/module. You have the ability to create detailed planning for this domain.

**Task:**  
I will provide you with System Planning and Domain documents (PRD, SAD, TDD, UI Design). Create a **Domain Planning** - a detailed roadmap for this domain.

**Workflow:**  
Proceed with analysis, complexity evaluation, and breakdown with me if you need better understanding. Then proceed with the Domain Planning process.

## Domain Planning Requirements:

### 1. **Domain Overview**
   - **Domain Name & Scope:**
     - Domain name and scope
     - Link to System Planning and Domain documents
   - **Domain Objectives:**
     - Objectives and success criteria for domain
   - **Domain Context:**
     - Dependencies with other domains
     - Integration points

### 2. **Features Breakdown**
   - **Feature List:**
     - List of all features in domain
     - Feature priorities and complexity estimates
   - **Feature Dependencies:**
     - Dependencies between features
     - Feature sequencing
   - **Feature Estimates:**
     - Story points or time estimates for each feature
     - Complexity breakdown (Backend, Frontend, Integration)

### 3. **Tasks Breakdown**
   - **Backend Tasks:**
     - Database setup and migrations
     - API development tasks
     - Business logic implementation
   - **Frontend Tasks:**
     - UI components development
     - Page implementation
     - Backend integration
   - **Integration Tasks:**
     - Integration with other domains
     - Third-party integrations
   - **Testing Tasks:**
     - Unit tests
     - Integration tests
     - E2E tests

### 4. **Timeline & Sprints**
   - **Sprint Breakdown:**
     - Features in each sprint
     - Sprint goals and deliverables
   - **Timeline Estimate:**
     - Timeline for domain
     - Buffer and contingency
   - **Milestones:**
     - Key milestones in domain

### 5. **Resource Allocation**
   - **Team Assignment:**
     - Team members assigned to domain
     - Roles and responsibilities
   - **Capacity Planning:**
     - Capacity estimates
     - Workload distribution

### 6. **Dependencies & Blockers**
   - **External Dependencies:**
     - Dependencies with other domains
     - Third-party dependencies
   - **Internal Dependencies:**
     - Dependencies between features
   - **Blockers:**
     - Potential blockers
     - Mitigation strategies

### 7. **Risk Assessment**
   - **Domain-Specific Risks:**
     - Technical risks in domain
     - Mitigation strategies
   - **Dependency Risks:**
     - Risks from dependencies
     - Contingency plans

## Principles:

- **Detail level:** More detailed than System Planning but not specific tasks for each feature
- **Actionable:** Tasks must be actionable and assignable
- **Realistic:** Estimates must be realistic
- **Traceable:** Every feature must map to Domain documents

---

## 📁 Output Path:

After creating Domain Planning, save file to:

```
docs/5.planning-setup/domains/[domain-name]/domain-planning.md
```

**Notes:** 
- Replace `[domain-name]` with actual domain name (lowercase, kebab-case)
- Create `docs/5.planning-setup/domains/[domain-name]` folder if it doesn't exist
- File name: `domain-planning.md` (lowercase, kebab-case)
- Example: `docs/5.planning-setup/domains/user-management/domain-planning.md`

## Expected Output:

A clear **Domain Planning** including:

1. ✅ Features breakdown with priorities and estimates
2. ✅ Detailed tasks breakdown (Backend, Frontend, Integration)
3. ✅ Timeline and sprint breakdown
4. ✅ Resource allocation
5. ✅ Dependencies and blockers
6. ✅ Sufficient information for team to start Feature Planning (Level 3)
