- System PRD, System SAD, System TDD, System UI Design (already available)
- System Planning (already available)

**Output:**
- Architecture alignment review
- Overall code quality review
- Overall security review
- Overall performance review
- Refactoring recommendations

### **Level 2: Feature Review**
📄 File: `2.feature-review.md`

**When to use:**
- After implementing a specific feature (Backend + Frontend)
- Need to review feature implementation
- Need to ensure feature meets requirements

**Input:**
- Feature Implementation (Backend + Frontend)
- Feature PRD, Feature SAD, Feature TDD, Feature UI Design (already available)
- Feature Planning (already available)

**Output:**

## Recommended Workflow

### **Step 1: System Review (Level 1)**
```
1. Use prompt: 1.system-review.md
2. Input: System Implementation + System documents
3. Output: System Review Report + Refactoring recommendations
4. Apply refactoring if needed
```

### **Step 2: Feature Review (Level 2) - Repeat for each feature**
```
1. After implementing a feature
2. Use prompt: 2.feature-review.md
3. Input: Feature Implementation + Feature documents
4. Output: Feature Review Report + Fixes
5. Apply fixes immediately
```

## Principles:

- **Continuous:** Review after each feature, don't wait until the end
- **Comprehensive:** Cover all aspects: code, architecture, security, performance
- **Actionable:** Provide specific fixes, not just detect issues
- **Automated Fixes:** Auto-fix when possible, not just report

## Checklist before review

- [ ] Have implementation code
- [ ] Have design documents (PRD, SAD, TDD, UI Design)
- [ ] Have planning documents
- [ ] Code has passed basic tests

**Start with Feature Review after each feature implementation!**
