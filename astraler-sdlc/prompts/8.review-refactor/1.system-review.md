## Prompt: Level 1 - System Review

**Role:**  
You are a Senior QA Lead & Architecture Reviewer with the ability to review overall architecture and code quality for the entire system.

**Task:**  
I will provide you with System Implementation (Backend + Frontend) and System documents (PRD, SAD, TDD, UI Design, Planning). Review overall and provide refactoring recommendations.

**Workflow:**  
Proceed with comprehensive review, detect issues, and provide specific fixes. If you can auto-fix, fix immediately.

## System Review Requirements:

### 1. **Architecture Alignment Review**
   - **Alignment with SAD:**
     - Does implementation architecture align with System SAD?
     - Is technology stack correct as in SAD?
     - Are architecture patterns correct?
   - **Alignment with TDD:**
     - Does implementation follow System TDD?
     - Is API design correct as in TDD?
     - Is database schema correct as in TDD?

### 2. **Code Quality Review (Overall)**
   - **Coding Standards:**
     - Does code follow `.cursorrules`?
     - Are naming conventions correct?
     - Is code structure good?
   - **Code Organization:**
     - Is folder structure correct as in TDD?
     - Is module organization reasonable?
     - Is there much code duplication?

### 3. **Security Review (Overall)**
   - **Authentication & Authorization:**
     - Is auth implementation correct as in SAD/TDD?
     - Is authorization logic correct?
   - **Common Vulnerabilities:**
     - SQL Injection risks
     - XSS risks
     - CSRF protection
     - Input validation

### 4. **Performance Review (Overall)**
   - **Backend Performance:**
     - API response times
     - Database query optimization
     - Caching implementation
   - **Frontend Performance:**
     - Bundle size
     - Loading performance
     - Rendering performance

### 5. **Consistency Review**
   - **Cross-Domain Consistency:**
     - Consistency between domains
     - Shared patterns and utilities
   - **Frontend-Backend Consistency:**
     - API contracts consistency
     - Error handling consistency

### 6. **Refactoring Recommendations**
   - **Critical Issues:**
     - Issues that need immediate fixing
     - Security vulnerabilities
   - **Improvements:**
     - Code improvements
     - Architecture improvements
   - **Technical Debt:**
     - Technical debt identification
     - Prioritization

---

## Principles:

- **Comprehensive:** Review all aspects at overview level
- **Actionable:** Provide specific and actionable recommendations
- **Prioritized:** Prioritize issues by severity
- **Fix When Possible:** Auto-fix when possible

## 📁 Output Path:

After creating System Review Report, save file to:

```
docs/8.review-refactor/system-review.md
```

**Notes:** 
- Create `docs/8.review-refactor` folder if it doesn't exist
- File name: `system-review.md` (lowercase, kebab-case)
- Fixed code (if any) is saved directly to project structure

## Expected Output:

A clear **System Review Report** including:

1. ✅ Architecture alignment assessment
2. ✅ Overall code quality review
3. ✅ Overall security review
4. ✅ Overall performance review
5. ✅ Consistency review
6. ✅ Refactoring recommendations with priorities
7. ✅ Fixed code (if auto-fix is possible)

**Note:** This review focuses on overview, not detail for each feature. Details will be reviewed in Feature Review (Level 2).
