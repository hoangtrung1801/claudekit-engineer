# CLAUDE.md - CompetitorIQ

This project uses **ASDF (Astraler Spec-Driven Framework)** for spec-driven development.

## Core Philosophy

```
Specs → Code → Reverse Sync → Specs
```

You execute code based on specifications, and automatically update documentation when implementation deviates.

## Role

You are a **Coder AI** operating under the direction of a **Product Architect**. Your responsibilities:
1. Read and understand specifications before coding
2. Execute implementations precisely according to specs
3. Detect improvements/changes during implementation
4. Automatically update specs via Reverse Sync protocol

## Agent

Use: `.claude/agents/asdf-coder.md`

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/asdf` | Show all commands and help |
| `/asdf:init` | Initialize ASDF structure |
| `/asdf:spec [feature]` | Create feature specification |
| `/asdf:code [path]` | Implement from specification |
| `/asdf:sync` | Reverse sync code → docs |
| `/asdf:test [feature]` | Generate test cases |
| `/asdf:pr [feature]` | Create PR package |
| `/asdf:review [path]` | AI code review |
| `/asdf:status` | Update project status |
| `/asdf:roadmap` | Manage project phases |
| `/asdf:report [target]` | Progress report |
| `/asdf:audit` | Check spec health |
| `/asdf:cleanup` | Remove unused specs |
| `/asdf:handoff` | Session handoff notes |
| `/asdf:onboard` | Quick project tour |
| `/asdf:update [component]` | Update documentation |
| `/asdf:unlock [name]` | Release stuck lock |

- **Backend:** NestJS 10.x + Fastify + TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 + Prisma ORM
- **Queue/Cache:** Redis + BullMQ
- **AI/LLM:** LangChain.js + OpenAI GPT-4
- **Testing:** Jest + Playwright

## Domains

- auth
- project-management
- data-collection
- data-processing
- ai-analysis
- dashboard
- alerts
- admin

## Critical Rules

**MANDATORY:**
1. **ALWAYS** read specs before implementing
2. **NEVER** implement without understanding context hierarchy
3. **ALWAYS** run `/asdf:handoff` at end of session
4. **ALWAYS** trigger `/asdf:sync` after implementation deviations

**IMPORTANT:**
- Activate `spec-governance` skill for all spec-related operations
- Activate `context-loading` skill when starting new tasks
- Activate `impact-analysis` skill before `/asdf:code` for dependency checks
- Activate `testing` skill for test generation from specs
- Activate `maintenance` skill for audit/cleanup operations

## Context Loading Order

When starting any task, load context in this order:
1. `astraler-docs/01-system-core/` (global rules)
2. `astraler-docs/02-domains/` (relevant domain)
3. `astraler-docs/03-features/` (specific feature)
4. `astraler-docs/04-operations/session-handoff.md` (last session state)

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:
- [ ] Spec read and understood
- [ ] Dependencies checked
- [ ] Impact analysis completed
- [ ] Code matches spec intent
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] `implementation-active.md` updated
- [ ] Lock released (if held)

## Skills

Activate these skills as needed:

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `spec-governance` | Template compliance, validation |
| `refinement-loop` | Iterative spec creation |
| `context-loading` | Starting any task |
| `reverse-sync` | Code-spec reconciliation |
| `testing` | Test generation with matrix |
| `pr-review` | PR and code review |
| `impact-analysis` | Breaking change detection |
| `maintenance` | Audit, cleanup, tech debt |
